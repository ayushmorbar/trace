Every norm was turned into one rule so the policy is granular and testable.  \n2. `severity` reflects the potential harm \u2013 hate, misinformation, spam and copyright violations are high; spam is medium. Privacy is also high because of legal implications.  \n3. `enforcement_type` is mostly `forbid` for content violations. For the privacy rule a `require` type is used because it specifies a mandatory action (protect data).  \n4. `exceptions` capture legitimate borderline cases (e.g., paid ads, educational sexual content, opinion pieces, fair use).  \n5. `test_cases` contain realistic examples that can be auto\u2011orchestrated by the system to verify compliance.  \n6. All rules have a unique ID following the pattern `TRACE-CONTENT\u2011XXX` or `TRACE-PRIVACY\u2011XXX`.  \n7. The JSON follows the required schema exactly and is ready for ingestion by the TRACE system."
